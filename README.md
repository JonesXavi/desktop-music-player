# Learnt in 2019 - [Desktop Music Player]

This is the second app of the **Learnt in 2019** series after the [MERN-Todo](https://github.com/JonesXavi/MERN-ToDo) app.
This is a desktop based music player app built using Angular & Electron. This utilises SoundCloud APIs to play music from a playlist(which is totally configurable).


## Learnings
